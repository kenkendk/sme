New in version 0.4.4 since 0.4.3

***********
* Changes *

- Added support for passing objects by reference to functions.
- Changed call to Run() when specifying an exit condition.
- Made the internal memory of RAMs in SME.Components public, as this is useful
  for verification.

*********
* Fixes *
*********
- Added "block" as an VHDL keyword.
- Procedures without arguments shouldn't have parenthesis in VHDL.
- Fixed nameclash in variables local to a method. The decompiler would rename
  local variables to a lower case version of the variable it is copying. This
  is a problem in VHDL, as it is case insensitive.
- Fixed a problem where irregular loops wouldn't run for a correct number of
  iterations.
- Handled nameclash for static constants.
- Fixed problem where RAM in SME.Components would throw an exception, due to
  them reading undefined values.
