New in version 0.4.3 since 0.4.2

***********
* Changes *
***********
- Added the option to not render the buses, when generating the dot graph. This
  allows for a much cleaner graph.
- Inferred true dual port memory are now more portable. The old definition
  produced inconsistent behaviour, depending on which VHDL simulator was being
  used.
- Moved function definitions in VHDL into the process definition. This allows
  the functions to access variables and buses, which are local to the process.

*********
* Fixes *
*********
- Fixed error when initializing multidimensional arrays.
- Fixed triggering of unclocked processes. Before, clocked processes wouldn't
  properly set the signal triggering unclocked processes.
- Fixed Windows line endings not being stripped in csv_util.vhdl.
- Fixed wrong name generation, when the first instance of a process came from
  a different namespace. E.g. when the first process was a
  SME.Components.TrueDualPortRAM, all names would start with SME_Components
  instead of the proper namespace of the process.
